<p>It was a cold, windy, frosty night. The girls were holding on to eachother so they would´nt fall. The boys were sliding around everywere. 
    There were people everywere rushing to get inside to get their seats because its far too cold to stay outside. 
    At the door we were all handed clown masks, maybe for some souvenir or something, im not sure but they seemed to be.</p>

<p>It did seem a little weird at the start but we were all so excited that we just got on with it. 
    The music at the circus was not happy, it was dark, dingly and scary like the music they play in horror movies.
     When I think about it IS the exact music they use in horror movies. Wait what is going on? The clowns are telling us to put our masks on. 
     One girl had lost her mask and a man did not get one so they were taken to the front by the clowns. 
     All the girls in my lane were holding hands because they were really scared by the situation. 
     We were all hoping that the show were going to end soon or that is was some kind of joke or something. 
     But the show continued and the clowns threatned us that if we did not put the mask on there would be consequences. 
     Two little girls refused to put the masks on so they were dragged up on the staged and had to call their parents and tell them that they loved them and always will and that they hoped that they would see them again. 
     The most terryfying things happened to them.
     The crowd became silent and everyone had their masks on.</p>

<p>The show started. The clowns started to bring out some weird creatures to the scene. Things I have never seen in my life. 
    They looked very scary and they also looked half dead. The crowd did not say a word throughout the whole show and I started to get escape feelings. </p>

<p>The show finally ended and the people shook with fear. The clowns warned everyone that if anyone said anything about what happened to the girls to anyone, the same thing would happen to them. 
    The girls never said a word to anyone else and they could not be alone for a long time and would always have sleepovers because the show had scarred them for life. 
    Some of the boys on the other hand thought the show was funny and told other people about it. Those boys were never seen or heard of ever again.</p>

           <p> Kids see things that adults don't. Trust me, I know. I was a kid at one point. Almost like a sixth sense or something. The gift fades however. Our senses diminish until it is impossible to pick up on the little things.
Our sight goes first, not our eyesight mind you, but the ability to see things. Those shadows you see rush through your peripherals. Those lights in the sky. Anything you think you might have seen as an adult would look extremely different to the eyes of a kid.
The next to go is our hearing. Things may still go bump in the night, but when we are kids, the noises are a lot more prominent. Where you might hear a muted knock on your door in the middle of the night, a child may pick up on footsteps. Louder and louder as they climb the stairs of the family home, only to stop right outside of the bedroom.
I’m telling you this so that when you have kids, you may try and listen to them a little better. The nightmares they have may be because they know more than you. Don’t just shun them because you can't see what they see; because you don’t hear what they hear. I wish mine wouldn’t have.
Some may argue that sight is the strongest sense. Some say hearing is impossible to live without. However, in my experience, smell is the sense that will evoke the most emotion. When you smell a rose, what images come to mind? Is it love? Your mother’s garden back at home? What about a well cooked meal? It is odor that has the power to drag us back into our childhood emotions. It’s smell that can make us feel at home, or disgust us. Smell has that power. Not sight. Not hearing. Those are important, but no where near as powerful.
I’m going to tell you my story; It begins when I was a kid, around 12 years old. Summer was the time to be alive as a kid. The smells of barbecues on the grill. The spanning fields of flowers in my town, even now I can close my eyes and see the colors, vibrant. Soaking up the sun in the meadows behind my neighborhood with my best friend Mica. She was special to me then. Even more so now, but loving as a kid is very different than loving as an adult.
Kids love with an animalistic essence. They can’t describe their feelings, they don’t know what to feel except drawn in to a person. That was Mica to me. She would occupy my every thought, and even though I would never admit it to anyone, I loved her. We would do everything from sit and read together to climb trees together. She was always there for me, and I was always there for her.
We would run through the vast pastures and chase each other through the streams. Her short raven hair, fluttering in the breeze. She always smelled of the flowers in the fields that we would rush through. We would climb the tallest trees in the forest just to see the world from up there. Free spirits we were. Even after we had met the man the first time.
The man seemed odd to us as a kids. He was so eloquently dressed for a man found in the forest.</p>
<p>I still remember his dark suit today. He wore a black jacket with a black vest. His slicked back black hair with peppered grey sides formed perfectly on his head. On his face sat a pair of wireframe glasses, immaculate. Everything about this man seemed put together. In fact, I had only seen one person before with this likeness.
Months before, I had gone with Mica and her family to her father’s dinner party. Everyone was invited from her dad’s work, an insurance agency I believe. The boss was a stout man, rather disenchanting. Gray suit, gray tie, gray shoes. However, a man loomed in the corner, a man that only sipped on a glass of wine and observed the social events. A man who wore a dark suit with a black vest and wireframe glasses. He seemed to pass through the other guests’ eyes without sparking a single glance. But Mica and I had both seen him. He waved at us and flashed a smile. Being nervous kids at an uncomfortable dinner party, we bolted upstairs to immerse ourselves in the familiar. Which happened that night to be a pizza her parents had ordered for us and cartoons.
The familiar man seemingly came from nowhere, rounded the corner around a tree as if he had been waiting there for hours. Despite the summer heat, the man had not removed his jacket. His hair remained slicked back, as if the air wasn’t humid enough to cause it to fall out of place. Immediately after we saw the man, he smiled and waved. I don’t know what caused this to happen, if it was fear, or plain distress, but I grabbed Mica by the hand and pulled her away. My eyes narrowed into tunnel vision as I saw the break in the tree line. As I dragged Mica out behind me, I noticed that I couldn’t smell the sweet scent of flowers. I couldn’t hear my feet breaking the leaves of the forest floor. I could only see the stream that signaled the exit of the forest. We didn’t stop until we were back at home. Sweat formed at both of our brows, and fatigue had set into our legs by the time when we got home.
That night, we each told our parents about what happened. About the man who was at the dinner party. About how we had seen him once again in the middle of the woods. Telling stories is what they called it. There had been no immaculatly dressed man in attendance to the dinner party. In fact, according to them, the only man who showed up in a suit was Mica’s dad’s boss. Try as we could, we could not convince our parents of what we had seen. And soon enough, we as well had forgotten the man. It took a few days, but we gathered the courage to return to our favorite part of the woods; where we had seen the man not a week earlier.
Kids unfortunately forget things rather easily. An intimidating man was not enough to keep us away. Oh how I wish that we had though. If only my parents had been convinced of a strange man lurking in the middle of the forest.
Mica and I returned on what I believe was a Sunday, after our parents had dragged us to church. Where some sermon had been prepared about the dangers of letting evil into your life. How it would fester and destroy everything it could lay its filthy hands on. This was indeed a very dark subject for a few kids, but I remember it well, so I guess it served its purpose. The pastor was an eccentric man, “The DEVIL WILL SHOW HIMSELF TO YOU!” he had bellowed. Practically yelling in the faces of the churchgoers. “He will become known to you, and no matter what. you WILL turn him down. For what he offers is eternal damnation.”
Devils and demons. No child had time to be bothered by such things. As our parents returned home to bury their noses in their bibles to keep the demons at bay, us kids ran to the woods. Ran to the very thing that we had so eagerly fled from a week before. This time would be different we told ourselves. We would climb the trees and move through the branches. We wouldn’t be bothered by the man were he to show himself again. He couldn’t find us in the trees.
Kids can stare danger in the face and not even blink. They can look at running rapids and jump in believing fully in their ability to swim against the currents. They can climb the tallest tree and not feel that tingling in their toes that you or I would get from such heights. Even writing this, I can feel my toes curl at the prospect of such heights. Maybe fear is what we trade our heightened childhood senses for. Fear is strong too.
Maybe if we had feared the height, things would have played out differently, but we hadn’t. We had risen to the top of a magnolia tree. Probably about 40 feet off the ground was where we found ourselves, but not for long. There was a limb that we knew only too late was decrepit. Termites had gnawed at the insides of this tree, and while it looked alive, it was dead on the inside. This perfectly beautiful and immaculate tree was empty. There wasn’t enough strength in the branch that held Mica aloft, so when she placed her weight a little unevenly on the branch, it gave. Gravity did the rest. As her poor body plummeted to the forest floor below, I could not climb down fast enough to stop her. Branch after branch broke as her little body crashed down the tree finally landing with a thud against the forest floor.
Her scent of flowers was gone immediately, her light had drained and she was still. Frozen as if she were merely a sculpture someone had created at the base of that cursed tree. I leapt from the tree once I was at a safe height, the branch underneath me breaking just as I pushed off of it. I crashed next to her lifeless body and yelled out, “HELP! Please! Someone help!”
For what felt like eternity, I clutched the lifeless body of my best friend. The one person whom I had loved. Tears fell down my face until it hit me. A smell of rotten eggs found its way up my nose as a figure, clad in a dark suit, kneeled before me. It must have been the tears that obscured my vision, but this man had seemingly appeared out of thin air. He looked at me and put a hand on Mica’s forehead.</p>
<p>“Not long before this one leaves us for good,” The man had said. Somber in tone, but not sad.
“Help me then. Please, help her.” My tiny voice shook from the fear of losing her for good.
“Are you sure you want my help, I can promise you that you may be better off letting your friend die here and now. But I can save her if that is your wish.”
“Yes, save her. Save her now.” I lashed out and struck the ground as hard as I could. The man looked at me and smiled. He pushed his glasses up his nose and whispered something into Mica’s ear. Immediately I saw her chest rise and fall as if she had taken a great breath after holding it for some time. I was too distracted with my now breathing friend. The smell of flowers returned, and her brown eyes looked up at mine, welling with tears. The man stood up and looked at me, piercing my soul with his bright blue eyes.
He told me to stay safe, that I owed him something now. He would be back to get it. Dread overcame me. It was as if all hope had been drained from me at that very instant. Mica pulled me off of my knees in the forest. She pulled my face next to hers and planted a big kiss right on my lips, and immediately the world was happy again. We ran as fast as we could to the stream. To the road and to our houses. She didn’t remember falling from the tree; in fact, she remembered a different story entirely. From Mica’s point of view, she never touched the tree. It was me who had fallen. Me who had died and been brought back by the man. The man in the dark suit
Of course we were scared. One of us had died. To each of us, we had nearly lost our best friend. We never returned to that stretch of the woods. Not for years at least. And definitely not willingly.
Over the course of my life I would find myself seeing this man. He would be sipping a drink at the shop where I would grab my coffee on the way to school. I would hear feet falling and stopping right outside of my childhood bedroom. He would show up and disappear at a moments notice, always flashing a smile in my direction. He seemed to be following me, watching me, until gradually I stopped seeing him. Stopped hearing footsteps in the hallways at night. He vanished from my life as quickly as he had appeared. I nearly forgot about him, but some part of me was holding onto the memory of this strange man who had saved Mica’s life.
It took years but me and Mica began dating. We were probably 16 at the time I asked her out. We would drive everywhere, just talking about nothing, enjoying each other’s presence. It wasn’t until we took a back street that led us to a dirt road in the forest that we began to talk about the man in the suit. We had been avoiding the topic since that fateful Sunday. Since one of us had fallen from that decrepit magnolia. We talked for a good 30 minutes about the man who had appeared to save one of us before we saw it. Right in front of where we had parked sat an old magnolia tree. Broken branches littered the ground around the tree. On its dead limbs sat no leaves. The thing, once beautiful now appeared as dead on the outside as it was on the inside. And it was there that we saw him.
The man in the suit rounded the corner of the magnolia. The headlights from the car illuminated his broken glasses. His hair fell around his face, and his suit was tattered. He grinned a crooked grin at us before I had the courage to throw the car in reverse and drive away. I’ll never forget the odor that pierced the car. It’s hard to forget. Especially now. Sulfur. The same rotten smell from my childhood.
It seemed to take hours to drive away from that tree. We had no idea how we got there, we didn't even remember there being a road leading to that place, but there was no mistaking that tree. Or that man. We didn’t discuss the topic any more, but his crooked grin was burned into our minds. His face beckoned us to join him. It was on that long drive back home that I remembered what he had whispered in my ear. What he had whispered in Mica’s ear. “I will follow you, I will take you on your 25th birthday.”
As it so turns out, that both Mica and I had fallen from the tree. Both of us had taken the bargain, to save the other. Both of us had heard the same whisper. We dropped the subject, and never talked about it again. If things could only be different
That’s why I’m writing this story. It’s nearly midnight. Mica’s 25th birthday. She’s asleep, finally. It took her a long time, the crooked man's words keeping her eyes from shutting. I told her I would stay up and keep watch. That’s the thing though. It’s too quiet, too serene. I can’t see anything except for our empty studio apartment. I guess it’s like I said, my sixth sense has faded.
I love her so much, but now I smell brimstone; now I’m scared, and I can’t see a thing.</p>
